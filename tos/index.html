		    		      <p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>11. Unlimited Plan</h3>
		      <p>In the best interest of our customers, Slime Hosting does not put a hard limit on the amount of players that may connect to the server, the amount of memory a server may use, nor the amount of bandwidth a server may use. 

<li>All services are still subjected to software limitations and physical hardware limits. 

<li>With Minecraft servers, the software requires a specified number of player slots to be set, as well as a set memory limit and storage limit. By default, your Minecraft server will be set up with a player limit of 100 users, a memory limit of 6GB, and a storage limit of 20GB. These are soft limits, and will be increased for no additional charge upon request. </li>

<li>To be eligible for additional resource allocation, your usage must be nearing or exceeding your current soft limit, while being in compliance with the rest of these terms. We reserve the right to require that any outstanding issues, such as plugin errors, be resolved before additional resources are allocated. </li>

<li>or Minecraft servers, CPU usage is restricted to a maximum usage of 200% of the server CPU cores. As the Minecraft software, by itself, is limited to utilization of a single CPU core, this restriction is only in place to prevent CPU usage abuse by third party software, such as malicious server plugins. </li>

<li>or Minecraft servers, unlimited storage only applies to the game server world data. Additional data, such as backups, logs, or files generated by third party plugins, are not eligible for storage limit increases. MySQL server storage is unmetered, and is recommended for third party plugin usage.</li>
			<h3>11. Refunds</h3>
		      <p>All orders that is place with Slime Hosting have a valid refund guarantee of 5 Days, after the first 5 days of the user being with Slime Hosting the refund policy will expire and the user will only gain a refund if their is an issue with the service they hold.</p>
		      <p>All refunds must be made through the client area or via a support ticket.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  		      <h3>12. Free Extras</h3>
		      <p>All client's that are eligible for our free service "FREE BungeeCord server" " FREE Web Hosting" will only receive the free addon once and will not be able to claim another "FREE BungeeCord server" or "FREE Web Hosting" after the first one has been claimed.</p>
		      <p>If you have an issue with agreeing to this then please contact our support team.</p>

								I've Had many hosts, including McProhosting, RedstoneHosts, and Many more, but Slime Hosting, is by far the best for the price, $3/Gb Who can beat that! I currently have 5 servers hosted with them, and they run bungeecord flawlessly, The owner of the host is very friendly and always there to lend a hand and give advice! When you use this host you are getting more than just a server you're getting amazing support and amazing speeds!

					I've used many different hosts the past year for my minecraft server, changing every month. I finally found the perfect one, Slime Hosting This hosting company has a very good support system, I wait maximum 1 hour for a reply! The prices are the cheapest you can find, while they have the best quality, and fastest servers! I run a server with MANY plugins, and i am trying to get as many games and gamemode plugins as Mineplex, till now, i never faced any lag at all! You can buy the spider plan for only $30/month which would give you unlimited RAM! I really recommend using Slime Hosting!

I only recently got a server with Slime Hosting, and I have to say, it was one of the best decisions I have made! I previously used Fluctis Hosting, MCProHosting and HostHorde and NONE of them have been as awesome and amazing as Slime Hosting. The support team have been really funny and extremely helpful in sorting out issues and stuff and giving advice. They are also really chatty and fun to talk to.
Now, to the servers they are hosted off - I run an intensive modpack (Crackpack) and I get around 20-30 people on all the time. The servers hold up really well, considering there are many chunk updates and people using the spells. The TPS always stays around 19.98-*20.00 even with 30 people on; My other hosts failed on that point, causing the TPS to drop to about 7.00-10.87. This is a real strong point for the host as it makes your server reliable and awesome!

I have used many server companies before such as McPro Hosting, Lime Hosting, Virtual Gladiators and also apex but non of them suited my server networks needs.
Then I found Slime Hosting I bought 7 servers with them for my network and the RAM usage was very low even with over 40 plugins installed, also there prices are cheap and affordable plus there support team are legendary you can get a reply within 1hr within posting a support ticket and all there staff are properly trained in live chat =)

						So ill start my review off by saying i've known the CEO of slime host for awhile before he did this we used to play minecraft a lot and sure i help by advertising his company and stuff and i was very skeptical of giving my money to him for a server but man i am glad i did. A few days ago my little brother was trying to start his own kitpvp server and was trying to port forward and all that so i got in touch with SlimeHost and asked what kind of help they could offer for him to make setting it up easier. I bought the server paid the extra setup fee and got a fully functional server without the hassle of having to setup perms and find and add the plugins not to mention the service i got when the server wasn't working right he instantly changed it and fixed all the issues right away incredible. Very soon i will be purchasing a server for myself and upgrading my brothers to a higher ram amount. Overall great prices, amazing support, and great choice that i've found in a long time.-Signed AcidGamesYT-
