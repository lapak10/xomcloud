								I've Had many hosts, including McProhosting, RedstoneHosts, and Many more, but Slime Hosting, is by far the best for the price, $3/Gb Who can beat that! I currently have 5 servers hosted with them, and they run bungeecord flawlessly, The owner of the host is very friendly and always there to lend a hand and give advice! When you use this host you are getting more than just a server you're getting amazing support and amazing speeds!

					I've used many different hosts the past year for my minecraft server, changing every month. I finally found the perfect one, Slime Hosting This hosting company has a very good support system, I wait maximum 1 hour for a reply! The prices are the cheapest you can find, while they have the best quality, and fastest servers! I run a server with MANY plugins, and i am trying to get as many games and gamemode plugins as Mineplex, till now, i never faced any lag at all! You can buy the spider plan for only $30/month which would give you unlimited RAM! I really recommend using Slime Hosting!

I only recently got a server with Slime Hosting, and I have to say, it was one of the best decisions I have made! I previously used Fluctis Hosting, MCProHosting and HostHorde and NONE of them have been as awesome and amazing as Slime Hosting. The support team have been really funny and extremely helpful in sorting out issues and stuff and giving advice. They are also really chatty and fun to talk to.
Now, to the servers they are hosted off - I run an intensive modpack (Crackpack) and I get around 20-30 people on all the time. The servers hold up really well, considering there are many chunk updates and people using the spells. The TPS always stays around 19.98-*20.00 even with 30 people on; My other hosts failed on that point, causing the TPS to drop to about 7.00-10.87. This is a real strong point for the host as it makes your server reliable and awesome!

I have used many server companies before such as McPro Hosting, Lime Hosting, Virtual Gladiators and also apex but non of them suited my server networks needs.
Then I found Slime Hosting I bought 7 servers with them for my network and the RAM usage was very low even with over 40 plugins installed, also there prices are cheap and affordable plus there support team are legendary you can get a reply within 1hr within posting a support ticket and all there staff are properly trained in live chat =)

						So ill start my review off by saying i've known the CEO of slime host for awhile before he did this we used to play minecraft a lot and sure i help by advertising his company and stuff and i was very skeptical of giving my money to him for a server but man i am glad i did. A few days ago my little brother was trying to start his own kitpvp server and was trying to port forward and all that so i got in touch with SlimeHost and asked what kind of help they could offer for him to make setting it up easier. I bought the server paid the extra setup fee and got a fully functional server without the hassle of having to setup perms and find and add the plugins not to mention the service i got when the server wasn't working right he instantly changed it and fixed all the issues right away incredible. Very soon i will be purchasing a server for myself and upgrading my brothers to a higher ram amount. Overall great prices, amazing support, and great choice that i've found in a long time.-Signed AcidGamesYT-

SlimeHost must be the best hosters out there!, there support team are just unbelievable there are very friendly always willing to help out and they are just great to talk to in general. Now i currently work for the server on there service and its just unbelievable for such a cheap price you get overwhelming results, we have around 50+ plugins on one server and no block lag of any kind has ever been experienced! there cpu is just simply the best.

As of soon I will be purchasing there $60 dedicated server because there are just like the best hosts i've ever seen and more likely will ever see in my life. I would really recommend buying from them you get what you pay for!
